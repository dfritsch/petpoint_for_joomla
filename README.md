Pet Point for Joomla (and Rescue Groups for Joomla)

A simple Joomla 1.5 Component to pull information from either PetPoint or RescueGroups.org databases for display on your website. Component has not been adapted for public release, but other developers can definitely use this as a base to get information from these systems.

If there is interest, we are willing to customize for Joomla 2.5 or Wordpress and also customize to pull from your account. Just let us know on our website at http://www.makethewebwork.com.
